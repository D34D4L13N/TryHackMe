Privilege escalation aims to gain root access by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. 
On Linux, kernel exploits are a common method, involving:
1. Identifying the kernel version (uname -r).
2. Searching for exploits via Google, Exploit-DB, or Linux Exploit Suggester (LES).
3. Transferring the exploit to the target machine (e.g., using Pythonâ€™s SimpleHTTPServer and wget).
4. Running the exploit, ensuring it is understood beforehand to avoid system instability.

Kernel exploits can crash systems, so they should only be used within the allowed scope. 
Some require further interaction, so reading instructions carefully is crucial.

### Q.1: find and use the appropriate kernel exploit to gain root privileges on the target system. 
There are a lot of different ways to exploit this kernel exploit. Let's go through the steps of the Kernel exploit Methodology.
1. Identify the kernel version.
```
$ uname -a
Linux wade7363 3.13.0-24-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 10 19:11:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
2. Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system.
This we can find with some quick Googling. Download the exploit and move it into your /tmp folder. https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292 

In our machine run this command: ```searchsploit linux kernel 3.13```. Then found some exploit that Privilage Escalation

```

```
Then download the exploit using this command: ```searchsploit -m linux/local/37292.c```
```
