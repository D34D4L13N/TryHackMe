## 📝 About This Repository
This repository contains my **personal write-ups** for labs and challenges on **TryHackMe**.  

I’ve completed the **Jr Penetration Tester learning path**, and I use this repo to:  
- Document how I solved labs and challenges  
- Revisit important concepts in penetration testing  
- Track my progress as I grow in cybersecurity  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
In these write-ups, I’ve compiled and rewritten information gathered from **online resources, walkthroughs, and documentation** for **learning purposes only**.  
The content is meant for **self-study and revision**, not as original research or official solutions.
